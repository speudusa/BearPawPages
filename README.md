### A Reading Buddy App


This is my final project for LaunchCode's CodeCamp Summer 2020.  

The story behind this project is to help me keep track of how much and what me and my children are reading. 

### Current Status (aka: My Scooter) 

This app currently allows the user to add books, note who is reading them, add any tags, and sort by progress.
It is built using ASP.NET Core in C# in a MVC format.  It's current features are user accounts, and the ability to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
