Regressing back to an app that WORKED

to have a version on GitHub that actually works before I next commit.  

Lesson learned here about VERSION CONTROL

And I could use the practice for revisiting viewmodels and the like


Okay, so THIS ACTUALLY WORKS now.  Going to commit it.

PLANS:  
	1. Update Razor page to change font and words when total = current page numbers
	2. Convert ViewBags to ViewModels
	3. Consider adding API for book info - (page numbers, author, title)
	4. DateTime???
	5. Users & Authorization

11/19/2020 - going to reconfigure the Delete method
			reviewing LaunchCode's ORM videos once again.  
				THIS CHAPTER:  https://education.launchcode.org/csharp-web-development/chapters/orm-relationships/index.html
			need to find a way to pick up the id of a book object and then create a path for it to be removed from the data

			DELETE FUNCTION IS WORKING!  WOOHOO!  BUT I would like to have this ONLY for adults  here AND on the details page
					(but that is more formatting than overall functionality at this point)
			
			updated port to 11111

	NOT WORKING:

			BookMark Mehtods:  InvalidOperationException: The model item passed into the ViewDataDictionary is of type 'BearPawPages.Models.Book', but this ViewDataDictionary instance requires a model item of type 'BearPawPages.ViewModels.AddBookViewModel'.
										Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewFeatures.ViewDataDictionary.EnsureCompatible(object value)

			Edit Methods: GET -- is working, can see boxes, they have labels and take input.  
						POST -- NOT working. http://localhost:11111/Books/Edit/2 => HTTP Error 405.  (client side)


*****GIT and mySQL Notes:  
			this solotion is in source/repos/BearPawPages

			Command Line to update DB::  dotnet ef database update  
								


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/17/2020 -- going to revert back only ONE model and viewmodel (B00k).  I need to UPDATE not create new tables.    
					One table -->  BOOKS  = use html to update things on the table as it stands now
							-- like color and text disyplay once completed (current = total page)

	CURRENT PROGRESS:  

		BooksController:  Updated Edit and EditBookData methods to take addBookViewModels
							--GET works, POST nope


		Edit.cshtml ==>  line 43 is causing problems.  If comment out, get request works, BUT unable to fulfil post request
					Also, not sure what is wrong with the value function
					Added notes on that line
					Error:  CS1503:  System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'

					updated HTML to use asp tags

	 - add to book to DB - via interface in VS
	 - delete book from DB - work on delete (as main row)
	 - edit = delete/add combo 

	 update table name
