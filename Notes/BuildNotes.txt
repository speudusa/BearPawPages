11/17/2020 -- going to revert back only ONE model and viewmodel (B00k).  I need to UPDATE not create new tables.    
					One table -->  BOOKS  = use html to update things on the table as it stands now
							-- like color and text disyplay once completed (current = total page)

	CURRENT PROGRESS:  

	BooksController:  Updated Edit and EditBookData methods to take addBookViewModels
						--GET works, POST nope


	Edit.cshtml ==>  line 43 is causing problems.  If comment out, get request works, BUT unable to fulfil post request
                Also, not sure what is wrong with the value function
				Added notes on that line
				Error:  CS1503:  System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'

				updated HTML to use asp tags
